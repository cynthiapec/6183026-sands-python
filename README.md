#Signals and Systems Midterm

#This project contains signal generation functions in Python, specifically unit step and sinusoidal signals. Separate files were created for the function (helper.py) definition and for the execution of the scripts (Run3.py). Run3.py also modifies the signals and plots them; the unit step is scaled by 2 and shifted by 0.5 seconds while the sinusoidal's amplitude is scaled by 0.5.
